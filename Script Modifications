finish updqtes
- pause before doing big updates to turn on secutity updates (maybe scriptable)

Redo auditing installation and configuration
Time zone configuration
unix time ^

uninstall other package managers as well (imagine pacman is installed lul)
we would have to disable their daemons too

List All Installed Programs:
apt list --installed
dpkg-query -l
snap list
flatpak list

https://ubuntu.com/security/cis
secure snap packages

Maybe try to fix the window resizing not working? (i cant find anywhere with a proper fix)
https://github.com/vmware/open-vm-tools/issues/303 (there are way too many different solutions on here, dont think any will work)
  sudo apt purge open-vm-tools
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install open-vm-tools open-vm-tools-desktop
